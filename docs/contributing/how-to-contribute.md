# How to contribute

I am personally _super_ grateful you're interested in contributing to Godot WRY. No contribution is too small, and all help is valued.

## Technical contributions

### Report bugs & issues

Found something broken? Let us know!

- Check the [open issues](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/issues) to make sure it's not already reported.
- Use the [report bug](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) template to create a new issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem are a _must have_ for other people to be able to see and debug your issue, so please include them!

### Contribute code

> [!NOTE]  
> It's always a good idea to create an issue with your suggestions before submitting a PR. If an issue already exists, please comment your interest on working on it to avoid double work.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always make sure the documentation is up to date with your changes, especially if your changes affect the API. For that, you can check [Writing documentation](/contributing/docs).

1. Fork the repo & clone it locally.
2. [Build the project](/contributing/compiling) and test it manually to make sure everything works.
3. Create a branch with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-webview-crash
   ```
4. Make your changes.
5. [Submit a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with a clear description of what you did.

You can work on any [open issues](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/issues) you want, especially ones tagged with **help wanted** or **good first issue**.

### Review code

Code reviews are just as valuable as writing code!

- Help catching bugs before merging.
- Suggest performance/code improvements.
- Ask questions when something isn't clear (this helps documentation)!
- Share knowledge with other contributors.

You can add yours comments, insights and suggestions to any [open PRs](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/pulls) you feel confident reviewing. If you're not familiar with reviewing code, GitLab's [What is a code review?](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review) is a great place to start.

### Demo projects

Examples help everyone understand how to use the project and demo what Godot WRY is capable of.

The examples live in the **"godot/addons/godot_wry/examples"** folder. They can be focused on demonstrating a specific feature or a use case for Godot WRY.

If you're insterested in building a demo project:

- Try to keep it small.
- Add it to the documentation with a clear writeup of what and how it's doing what it's doing.
- If the demo you want to make is too complex or out of scope, you can also share a link for a separate repo and we can figure it out.

### Documentation

Good docs is very important so developers can actually use and contribute to Godot WRY. You can check out the [Writing documentation](/contributing/docs) guide for more info on that.

## Community support

Helping users is incredibly valuable. If you have any bits of knowledge to share that can help figuring out any [open issues](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/issues), please do! Even if you can't solve a problem completely, partial answers still help!
