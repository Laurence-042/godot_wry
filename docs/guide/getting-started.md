# Getting started

This guide will help you set up Godot WRY and use the WebView node in your Godot project.

## Installing

There are a few ways to install Godot WRY for your Godot project:

### Asset Library

The easiest way to install Godot WRY is through Godot's [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3426). You can install it via the editor by following these instructions:

1. Open your project in Godot 4.1 or later.
2. Go to the "ðŸ“¥ AssetLib" tab at the top of the editor.
3. Search for "Godot WRY".
4. Click on the Godot WRY extension and click **Download**.
5. In the configuration dialog, click **Install**.

### GitHub releases

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/releases) page.
2. Download the latest release ZIP file (_not_ the source code).
3. Extract the contents into your project's "addons" folder (create one if it doesn't exist yet).

### Build from source

Use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to build the extension and move the binaries to the Godot project folder:

```bash
just build
```

Please refer to the [Building from source](/contributing/compiling) page for more details on how to compile the project binaries.

## Rendering webview

Once Godot WRY is installed and enabled, you can add a [WebView](/reference/webview) node to your scene:

1. In the Scene panel, click the "+" button or right-click and select "Add Child Node".
2. Search for "WebView", select it and then click "Create".

### Basic setup

You can configure your WebView properties in the inspector panel or using code:

```gdscript
$WebView.full_window_size = true
$WebView.transparent = true
$WebView.devtools = true
$WebView.zoom_hotkeys = true
```

> [!TIP]
> Notice that we set the `full_window_size` property to `true`. This will make the webview ignore any transforms and just take the size of the viewport, which can be very useful for making UIs.

### Loading content

In the inspector, you can set an initial URL to be loaded or an initial HTML to be displayed. If you want to load a different page or content during runtime, you can do so like this:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	# load a webpage...
	$WebView.load_url("https://godotengine.org")

	# or some custom HTML directly:
	$WebView.load_html("""
		<html>
		<head>
			<style>
				body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; }
                p { color: #ffffff; }
				h1 { color: #478cbf; }
			</style>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>Hello from Godot WRY!</h1>
			<p>This is HTML content rendered in a webview.</p>
			<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send message to Godot</button>

			<script>
				function sendMessage() {
					ipc.postMessage("Hello Godot WRY!");
				}
			</script>
		</body>
		</html>
	""")
```

If you now run your project, you should be able to see something similar to this:

## Interoperability

A very powerful feature of Godot WRY it the ability to exchange messages between your Godot game and the web content.

### From JavaScript to Godot

You can send messages from JavaScript to Godot using the [`ipc.postMessage()`](/reference/javascript#ipc-postmessage) function in JavaScript.

First, let's load some HTML with a button to send our message. Make sure to connect to the [`ipc_message`](/reference/webview#ipc-message) so we can retrieve the response later:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	$WebView.connect("ipc_message", self, "_on_ipc_message")

	$WebView.load_html("""
		<button onclick="sendToGodot()">Send data to Godot</button>
		<script>
			function sendToGodot() {
				ipc.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
					action: "update_score",
					score: 100,
					player: "Player1"
				}));
			}
		</script>
	""")

func _on_ipc_message(message):
	var data = JSON.parse_string(message)
	if data.action == "update_score":
		print("Updating score for %s to %d" % [data.player, data.score])
		# TODO: handle the data in your game...
```

> [!TIP]
> Notice that the message is sent as a JSON string. While any string would be valid, JSON makes it easier to identify message types and send complex data.

### From Godot to JavaScript

Similarly, you can also send messages from Godot to your web content using the method [`post_message()`](/reference/webview#post-message) in GDScript.

In this example, let's send a message when the player's health changes, so we can create a HUD with some simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display a health bar:

```gdscript
func update_player_health():
	var message = {
		"action": "update_health",
		"health": 20
	}
	$WebView.post_message(JSON.stringify(message))

func _ready():
	$WebView.load_html("""
		<progress id="healthBar" value="42" max="100"></progress>
		<script>
			document.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
				const data = JSON.parse(event.detail);
				if (data.action == "update_health") {
					const healthBar = document.getElementById("healthBar");
					healthBar.value = data.health;
				}
			});
		</script>
	""")
```

### Evaluating JavaScript

> [!WARNING]  
> Executing JavaScript from a string is an enormous security risk. It is far too easy for a bad actor to run arbitrary code when you use `eval()`. See [Never use direct eval()!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_direct_eval!).

You can also use [`eval()`](/reference/webview#eval) to evaluate any arbitrary JavaScript code you want. By following the same example above, we could update a player's health bar value directly like so:

```gdscript
var new_health: float = 20
$WebView.eval("""
	const healthBar = document.getElementById("healthBar");
	healthBar.value = %s;
""" % new_health)
```
